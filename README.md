# FBLA-SLC-Coding-and-Programming

Utilized Tkinter and python to develop a graphical user interface that recommends restaurants, tourist attractions, and monuments.
Works by asking for a username and password which if they match the username and password given in the database leads to a menu window where you can choose what you want recommended to you using the hamburger menu.
Utilizes an ip grabber using a python library called requests which calls a request on a url which returns the ip address of the user which is then converted to a geographic location using a library called geoip2 making it extremely simple for a user to search for a business or service that they desire or are looking for.
Also utilizes the google maps api to search for nearby businesses and services using a search word and a distance or a radius of travel that we look for a business in. 

Pros:
The google maps api has over 10 million places and is constantly being updated which provides a huge advantage over the 1000 or so you can manually input into a database.
The sqlite database is extremely lightweight and does not require a server to run

Cons:
The google maps api costs money but google does provide $200 worth of free credit however charges do rack up after a while.
Because sqlite is so lightweight it often shuts down connections due to an overload of requests for the database. In a commercial application the sqlite database would be replaced with a mySql database

Plans for improvement: 
Plan on implementing a recommendation system which will utilize the database of users and also implement a link to the website of the service the google maps api returns

Requirements: 
Python 3.7 or greater preferably 3.10
Windows operating system formatting doesn't work on MacOS
google maps library (pip install googlemaps)
geoip2 library (pip install geoip2)
requests library (pip install requests)
